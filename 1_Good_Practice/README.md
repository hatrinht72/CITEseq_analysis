#Good Practice
##Connect to 1 HPC/cluster to handle the big dataset (optional) 
Each experiment will acquire different temporaly memories of the computer. I decide to use plafrim to handle my experiment but you can use other cluster/HPC or eventually your computer. 
##Create an environment dedicated to downstream analysis
